# Project Overview

Global ultra-luxury dealer network(Modeled for Aston Martin-style analytics), where performance depends on:

* Retail sales effectiveness

* Aftersales & workshop efficiency

* Customer experience scores (CSI, NPS, complaints)

* Financial consistency (margin %, revenue mix)

* Dealer standards & operational compliance

This project simulates a realistic performance reporting system for Luxuary automotive like Aston Martin’s regional & global management teams.

## Key Insights Discovered

* Middle East delivers the most consistent CSI & NPS scores

* APAC has the highest margin %, showing strong pricing power

* Europe leads volumes but has uneven effectiveness

* Americas shows the biggest funnel drop-off and longest wait times

* Dealers with low audit scores consistently show low retention and higher complaints

These insights aren’t just data—they translate into real operational improvements.

This project reflects exactly the type of work I want to do. Turning operational performance into executive-ready insights,helping dealer networks grow profitably Connecting sales, service, and customer experience into one story. 
Delivering dashboards used by leadership for real decisions. It’s a blend of my strengths Data analysis, Business performance reasoning, Visual storytelling, Automotive passion
